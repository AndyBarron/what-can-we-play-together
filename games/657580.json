However, everything gets turned upside down when a pair of mischievous demons (a succubus and an incubus), pretending to be humans, move in next door to her. The two twins end up taking it upon themselves to “show her the error of her ways” by putting her in various unfortunate situations.","supported_languages":"English","header_image":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/header.jpg?t=1498696784","website":"https://www.patreon.com/CriticalBliss","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium 4 - 1.8 Ghz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OSX 10.6<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium 4 - 1.8 Ghz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space</li></ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04+, Debian 8+, openSUSE 13.1+, or Fedora Linux 21+<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium 4 - 1.8 Ghz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space</li></ul>"},"developers":["Team Bliss"],"publishers":["Critical Bliss"],"package_groups":[],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":true,"linux":true},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":22,"description":"Steam Achievements"}],"genres":[{"id":"71","description":"Sexual Content"},{"id":"72","description":"Nudity"},{"id":"4","description":"Casual"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_c12c7e633efdd65aebcda4cb2bf4e6a68fd867b8.600x338.jpg?t=1498696784","path_full":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_c12c7e633efdd65aebcda4cb2bf4e6a68fd867b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498696784"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_5bbc96ad1aceb526ef3b5d9f39cc90c0fbf9d643.600x338.jpg?t=1498696784","path_full":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_5bbc96ad1aceb526ef3b5d9f39cc90c0fbf9d643.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498696784"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_6fece3f6239841f418c0ba524088cfdad673965f.600x338.jpg?t=1498696784","path_full":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_6fece3f6239841f418c0ba524088cfdad673965f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498696784"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_11744b2fe05705da6cbeb35a39e7e47a628e9bf0.600x338.jpg?t=1498696784","path_full":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_11744b2fe05705da6cbeb35a39e7e47a628e9bf0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498696784"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_9a59ffd25691fb8b7cf07b16f9c6e188833ab52c.600x338.jpg?t=1498696784","path_full":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_9a59ffd25691fb8b7cf07b16f9c6e188833ab52c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498696784"},{"id":5,"path_thumbnail":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_d43b0dfb07b5245472527e4d0035e9b8b9197c96.600x338.jpg?t=1498696784","path_full":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_d43b0dfb07b5245472527e4d0035e9b8b9197c96.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498696784"},{"id":6,"path_thumbnail":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_7204425026ee8800a0a895dca4c431970db66506.600x338.jpg?t=1498696784","path_full":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_7204425026ee8800a0a895dca4c431970db66506.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498696784"},{"id":7,"path_thumbnail":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_1d98e88a94e6b17781e5e4ab8a34997ba5b6a179.600x338.jpg?t=1498696784","path_full":"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/657580/ss_1d98e88a94e6b17781e5e4ab8a34997ba5b6a179.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498696784"}],"movies":[{"id":256688491,"name":"What!?
