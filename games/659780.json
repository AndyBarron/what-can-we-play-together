{"type":"game","name":"Darkness and a Crowd","steam_appid":659780,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Update Notes</h1><p>After being greenlit, I've been working non-stop in order to ensure the release of this game is everything I have promised, and more. I have been working non-stop to bring to you the most fulfilling gameplay and intriguing story as I possibly can. In promises to release to you something I'd be proud to call mine.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Whats been happening</h2>So recently I have been working with Steam integration tactics to start implementing achievements, as some sort of furthering task to ensure players engagement to the game is as meaningful and dedicated as possible. Ive also added so much more since the first time I requested beta testing. The dialogue system, in due thanks to Vide Dialogues (Unity asset) was the perfect solution to bypass the feeling of loneliness without the need of hiring voice actors. This also set forth a way to bring meaning to the gameplay, and help implement tasks.<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659780/extras/Cactus_Achievment.jpg?t=1499335908\"> <img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659780/extras/KoolAid_Achievment.png?t=1499335908\"> <img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659780/extras/tutorial_Achievment.jpg?t=1499335908\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Whats to come?</h2>I will admit that I am not as far as I wish I could say I was. Which is why the release has been set further into the future (December 14th). Recently Ive been ensuring to mark down my base content before messing with making the game longer. I want to make sure I get down all of the core features. Multi-tasking priorities has been a big task, especially as an indie developer. But when I have more to show I will certainly update the store page and the games website as much as possible.<br><br>Another item I've completed is the trading card system. But given the game hasn't been released yet to show off its statistics to valve, trading cards will not be available until the late future.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Possibly to come?</h2>before I start this list I would like to make clear that none of this is guaranteed just ideas I'd like to toy around with and gather feedback on. To see if people are interested on seeing how this might play out.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> I would looove to incorporate some sort of multiplayer system to play with friends or possibly fight against them in a race against the clock or pure brute force tactics to eliminate one another. I want to gather a community and a following to make this a long term, always updating game. But the main story line has been the focus thus far.<br></li><li> Hats/different skins is something I would also LOVE to toy around with. Collecting skins to play as or trading one for another would be a fun community sharing aspect, but that'd also be a lot to put in. But I'm more than willing to put in the effort if enough people want to see it happen...</li></ul>please feel free to leave feedback in the discussions as to what you would like to see.<br><br>That is all I'd like to announce, I really appreciate your time into reading this. Please stay tuned if your interested in looking as to how the game progresses.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Darkness and a Crowd tells the story of a small creature and his friend, on an extensive journey to save the planet they once called home.<br><br>The game features an extensive upgrade system in order to shape your path as to how you progress through the main story.
