But your only way to interact with them is by issuing commandments. Once commandments are written, changing them will make your followers lose faith in you. Choose wisely and carefully what kind of god you want to be. <br> <br>How these commandments are interpreted and remembered is not set in stone. What you communicate and what experiences your followers have with the environment is the basis for their religion. Over time, commandments can develop different associations and completely change their meaning. After all, your followers still have a free will and will sometimes do what they think is best for them, regardless of what you had in mind.<br> <br>There is a lot going on underneath the surface in the world of Crest. Consequences of your actions may not always be clear and you will need to be aware of the ever-changing environment and your people's disposition, amongst others their disposition towards you. Expressing yourself is the key of Crest; you will do so through your people and the world they shape.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Write rules for your followers with ever-changing consequences.<br></li><li>Express your divinity in many different ways and see it reflected in your followers.<br></li><li>Your people have free will, focus on leading them rather than controlling their every move.<br></li><li> Procedurally generated experience with an average playthrough lasting more than an hour per session.<br></li><li>Emergent world where weather, vegetation, mineral deposits, drought and animal behavior will create surprises.<br></li><li>See the rich story you created by visiting the Chronicler in the Underworld.<br></li><li>An expressive game without end-goal where you can focus on building your legacy.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progression and Losing</h2>Every new world you start is unique; you can't have multiple saves of it so you will have to think carefully of what you want to do. If all your followers die that world is gone forever. However, you will be able to view the legacy of your old worlds. As long as your people live you can continue playing, and further shape your own history.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Setting</h2>Crest is an Afrofuturist game that reimagines how humanity arose in the cradle of humankind on the African continent. It's a historical themed game that tries to emulate an advanced iron age civilization that could have existed a few thousand years ago. The setting for the game world, its flora and fauna is based on African biomes, with rainfall determining the tug-of-war between desert, savanna and jungle.","about_the_game":"Welcome to Crest, a religion simulator where you take care of humans as if they were your own children.
