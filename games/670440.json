The birds were singing, there was a sound of running water nearby and a gentle, female voice was calling him from a white, wooden house. &quot;It could not be her&quot;, he said himself while dreaming. But it was her. His mother was standing on the doorstep, looking for him. <br>From that moment, he started coming to that house every night with the hope that he will speak with his parents and that maybe, he will find why they left him when he was still a baby.
