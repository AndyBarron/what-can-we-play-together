With thousands of asteroids putting our home planet in dire danger, it's up to you to blast away as many of these space rocks as you can before your demise.  It's not a question of &quot;if&quot; you will die, because you will.  The question is how many asteroids can you clear out before you die, thus increasing the chances the billions of people back on earth will survive!  When you finally lose your last ship, you'll watch earth either get destroyed by the asteroids you failed to blast, or see that you didn't die in vain.  <br><br>Rock 'N Roll offers exciting old school arcade action goodness which allows you the opportunity to collect resources and a number of power-ups as you work to clear the screens full of hundreds of rocks.  The resources can then be sold if you survive the level for your choice of either score points or currency which can be used to buy upgrades to your ship to help you survive increasingly difficult levels.  The power-ups include everything from a risk-vs-reward item which forces you into a high velocity movement speed scoring triple points to the unique &quot;Spi-Roll&quot; attack the game is named after which gives you a cool looking spiral ship attack when you feel trapped and vulnerable.","about_the_game":"Built entirely from the heart and passion of a true Asteroids! fan as a child growing up in the 80's, Rock 'N Roll is a unique arcade action shooter that puts you in full control of Earths fate!
