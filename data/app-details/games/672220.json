Wanna live in the middle of the Ocean? Wanna live in a middle of a green trees forest? Wanna live in hell? You can!<br>With the Dimensions system you can travel between dozens of Dimensions, each one different and unique from the other one, different blocks, resources, structures, different biomes and more. We have now also made the Dimensions more random so one Dimension will be different in every different seed. <br><br><strong>Action System:</strong><br>A wireless electricity system, got bored of doing everything manually? The Action system is just for you! We aim to make almost everything in the game farmable using different and interesting mechanics.

Nope, not in our game.<br>The Nests act as basically spawn zones in the game, they spawn creatures in a random range near them, and each Nest has a random creature it spawns. You can destroy it to stop the spawns but it wont give you the spawner. If you want to farm mobs, thats probably the best way you can currently do it.<br><br><strong>End Game Progression: (Still Heavily Under Progress)</strong><br>We believe that when players get to the end of a game like this one, they should be a lot more powerful and have a lot more tools to make things less grindy and easier for them so they can just create stuff easier. We are going to include things like super armor that lets you fly to help you building and fighting, tool that gives you higher range for placing and destroying blocks, more interesting ways and things to farm and more!","about_the_game":"Unlimited is a new generation voxel world game.
