Please read the description below to find out more information about what’s in each folder and their respective size and below that, a description of how best to unpack the 3d assets.<br><br>The Firebase DLC includes the following:<br><br>Firebase Video Files:<br><br><strong>Firebase_Film_Stereo</strong><br>•\tOatsFirebaseDLCStereo.mp4 – 7.25GB<br>o\t320 kbps AAC Stereo Audio<br>o\t1920x1080<br>o\th.264 40mbit/sec (approximately Blu-Ray quality)<br><br><strong>Firebase_Film_Surround</strong><br>•\tOatsFirebaseDLCSurround.mp4 – 7.3GB<br>o\t640 kbps AAC 5.1 Surround Audio<br>o\t1920x1080<br>o\th.264 40mbit/sec (approximately Blu-Ray quality)<br><br><strong>Firebase Booklet – Total size: 400 MB – File Name: Firebase_Booklet_v1</strong><br>•\tConcept Art<br>•\tVFX look-development<br>•\tOats Workshop BTS Selects<br>•\tFilming BTS selects<br><br><strong>Firebase 3d Assets: - 23.6GB</strong><br>•\tRivergod – 7.79GB<br>•\tRivergodstage2 – 9.74GB<br>•\tSpidermen – 6.11GB<br><br>*** What’s NOT included yet, but we hope to make available in the future: ***<br>•\tSound Synced Dailies (need to engage with community as to what the best/most useable format would be for this)<br>•\tSeparate Dialog-only Mix - 24-bit 48khz PCM Stereo WAV<br>•\tSeparate Sound Effects-only Mix – 24-bit 48khz PCM Stereo WAV<br>•\tSeparate Music-only Mix (24-bit 48khz PCM Stereo WAV) will be available only through purchase of the Oats Studios Volume Soundtrack which will be made available at a date to be confirmed.<br>•\t3D vehicle assets <br>•\tFirebase Script<br><br>A few general notes about all 3D assets uploaded for FIREBASE.<br><br><strong>LOOKDEV</strong><br>•\tThese folders contain the assembled 3dsmax file used for final rendering.  <br>•\tThey also contain all the necessary textures in the directory structure that should ensure everything is correctly linked.  It’s a very deep directory structure but it was the easiest way to collect the data to share with the community.  You can of course remap the directory structure on your own to simplify it.<br>•\tThese files (and shaders) are set-up to be used with Redshift (our renderer of choice).  However, you can rebuild them to work in whatever renderer you choose.<br>•\tThe model in this file is our working resolution (with displacement maps to render like the highres sculpt)<br>•\tThe model in this file is in the T-pose (NOT the pose displayed in the thumbnail)<br><br><strong>MODEL</strong><br>•\tWe provide a series of various model files and formats.<br>•\tCleaned up mudbox file with high and low resolution meshes (used for exporting our various displacements and working resolution models.<br>•\tTwo .obj files, one the lowres working model and one high resolution sculpt<br>•\tAll of these models are in the default T-pose (not the pose displayed in the thumbnail)<br><br><strong>RIG</strong><br>•\tThere are two files here, both Maya files (the program we use for animation)<br>•\tOne file is the “fast” animation rig.  This file does not contain the final working resolution mesh but instead contains a lower resolution cut-up mesh for fast animation interactivity.  Its rig also is a stripped-down version missing some of the slower fancy things.  Basically, this is the rig the animators work with 95% of the time.<br>•\tThe second file contains the same rig but with the full working resolution mesh with skinning.  It also contains extra bits in the rig to assist with skinning or secondary motion.  It is THIS file that you would export a model cache (whatever format you wish) from to then apply to the lookdev model for rendering.<br>•\tThe rigs are set-up to make use of the Maya referencing system so that if rig is REFERENCED in you can swap the reference on the fly.  To use this do not animate directly in the rig file.  <br><br>*** As a final note if you have issues or questions pertaining to any of these files please go to the Oats Studios Forum in the DLC category and ask away: <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://forums.oatsstudios.com/categories/dlc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://forums.oatsstudios.com/categories/dlc</a></p><br><h1>Stream Oats Studios Shorts Free on Steam</h1><p><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/633030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\" >http://store.steampowered.com/app/633030</a></p><br><h1>About the Software</h1>At Oats Studios, the creation of Volume 1 required immense resources.
