This creates an unpredictable environment, rich with the potential for emergent gameplay. Every encounter with creatures, players or new islands will bring with them new threats, experiences and conflicts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Work Together or Alone</h2>Wander the skies as a nomad or form crews to aid one another in exploration and ship building. Pool resources to travel more safely and build greater skyships, or risk your life stowing away on an enemy ship. The choice is yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skills-Based Gameplay</h2>There are no ‘levels’ or ‘levelling up’ in Worlds Adrift.  Everything you do - from exploring forgotten ruins to defending your ship from other players and creatures, depends on the creativity and skills that you learn as you play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Freeform Co-op &amp; PVP</h2>As an open sandbox game, you must choose your allies carefully and be cautious when your crew encounters others who seek the same treasures.  However, cooperating reaps rewards - craft and share items, show solidarity in team colors, and collaborate to build the most ambitious of skyships.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Player Agility &amp; Freedom</h2>With your trusty grappling hook, learn to scale the tallest towers and swing in between flying skyships with elegance.

Your skyship design will have direct consequences on its performance and handling. Will yours survive a storm wall?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Adapt &amp; Specialise Your Design</h2>Players will need to explore and scan the world to unlock ‘Knowledge’. This can be used to unlock schematics for advanced equipment, enabling specialisation and the building of more versatile skyships.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Craft Equipment to Aid Survival</h2>The world is full of dangers, and each biome presents new challenges. Craft player equipment to help you survive the elements, reach new destinations, and even manipulate the world around you. <br><br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/322780/extras/Page_Break_03.png?t=1499351585\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Hand-Crafted Experience</h2>The first game whose map is created by the community - each island in Worlds Adrift is hand crafted, resulting in a rich, varied game world.
