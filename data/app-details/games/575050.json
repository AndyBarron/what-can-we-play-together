{"type":"game","name":"Little Triangle","steam_appid":575050,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Little Triangle is a hardcore platformer that focuses on the fun rather than making it difficult. It provides both casual mode and hardcore mode. Both modes have the same level design and the major difference is the number of lives. In casual mode, you have multiple lives before the next checkpoint and in hardcore mode you have only one. For both modes, each level contains a few checkpoints so that the difficulty level is just right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you need some real relaxation, just grab Little Triangle and you can start enjoying the game immediately with no need to learn. In the game, we focus only on jumping rather than shooting or puzzle solving elements. By holding longer, you can jump further, and it supports double-jump in the air. Those are all the skills you need to master. Although it sounds easy, you need to control precisely and keep your hands busy to pass the levels. Also, after passing the levels, you may play again to explore the hidden areas. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout the art design, those various animations, styled characters and interesting graffities all make this game stand out among many other platformers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game perfectly supports both keyboard and controllers, and the gameplay is perfectly balanced for keyboard players and controller players.","about_the_game":"Little Triangle is a hardcore platformer that focuses on the fun rather than making it difficult.
