There is almost no atmosphere at the surface. At the same time the planet is pitted by caves that go many thousands kilometers down and keep all the life and air inside.<br>Koyte is really the planet of caves. Rumors say that about a thousand years ago the advanced civilization prospered on the planet. Ancient caves still store strange objects and mechanisms left by that civilization. Everything is different on the planet now. Something happened to those ancient forerunners. Now this mysterious world is divided into two - upper and lower ones. Some rational beings live in the upper world. Probably they are descendants of the ancient people as they feel quite cozy and good here. Life of the lower world is completely different. Ugly creatures, blood-thirsty predators, that know no mercy, live in the lower world. There is nothing more hated for them than the inhabitants of the upper world!
