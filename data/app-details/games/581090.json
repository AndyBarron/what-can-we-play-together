{"type":"game","name":"Radioactive","steam_appid":581090,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Welcome to the world of <strong>Radioactive</strong>, hit by a new and presently unknown infection which has wiped out most of the world's population. You are one of the few that have survived and now you must search this new wasteland in order to fight for your life against what is left of the indigenous population now infected with the disease. Gear up, choose your play style, as you choose your path in this brutal and chilling landscape using whatever means you stumble upon to survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This is Radioactive. And this is: your story.</h2><br>Radioactive is a gritty, authentic, open-world survival horror game, in which players follow a single goal: to survive in the harsh post-apocalyptic landscape as long as they can. Players can experience powerful events and emotions arising from the ever-evolving emergent gameplay. There are no superficial tips, waypoints, built in tutorials or help given to players. Every decision matters, there are no save games, no extra lives, every mistake can be lethal. If you fail, you lose everything and you need to play again from the beginning with nothing but your wits, and your two hands. Fight the hostile environment, loot, gear up and get ready for a fight!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES IN ALPHA</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 25 sq. km post-apocalyptic world.<br></li><li> Advanced/Realistic weapon system.<br></li><li> Realistic inventory system.<br></li><li> Zombie A.I System.<br></li><li> Locomotion system (Using VR controller/Touchpad).<br></li><li> Climbing system.<br></li><li> And more!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP</h2><br>Radioactive is currently in early alpha and we see a lot of work ahead of us in order to make it the true authentic open world zombie survival VR experience we want it to be. Current version is including only small subset of game mechanics and serves mostly as test bed with core technology that should serve as basis for future additions and improvements.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CURRENT ISSUES</h2><br>Currently, the biggest issue is the performance in the single-player terrain. We have few ideas that we are currently trying, thus, performance should improve within next few updates. As far as looting goes, since Single-Player has performance issues, there was no point for us to add a lot of loot or loot spawns around the map; That's being said, you will be able to find a weapon and consumables, but that's about it for now. Once performance issues are fixed, we will make sure our looting system is implemented short-after.","about_the_game":"Welcome to the world of <strong>Radioactive</strong>, hit by a new and presently unknown infection which has wiped out most of the world's population.
