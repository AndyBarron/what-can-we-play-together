{"type":"game","name":"MakeVR","steam_appid":569180,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"<strong>MakeVR</strong> is a 3D content creation experience with a natural style of interaction that lets anyone, regardless of age or experience level, step into a professional CAD engine and start building cool 3D objects and worlds on Day One.  MakeVR democratizes content creation through its extremely low learning curve because you use your own two hands as they were meant to be used, with very natural and intuitive interactions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3D Multi-Touch</h2>With two independently tracked hands in MakeVR, you can translate (move), scale, and rotate your environment in the same way you use 2D multi-touch on your smartphone, or tablet – but better. You simply reach out and grab a point in space and use that point to drag the entire world around: up, down, left, right, backward, and forward. If you grab two points, you can move your hands closer or further apart to scale the environment up or down and rotate it around you. Scaling in MakeVR is a powerful feature because it allows you to position yourself anywhere in the environment at whatever scale best suits the current task – so you’re always working in your comfort zone.<br><br><br>MakeVR’s 3D Multi-Touch is the next logical step in the evolution of interfaces, the perfect interface for the next generation of users who already expect a greater level of interaction. It’s a way of interacting with 3D content that is so natural and intuitive anyone can do it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Built-in CAD engine for models with a life beyond MakeVR</h2>MakeVR may be fun, but it's more than just a toy.  Because it incorporates a professional CAD engine, you have all the advanced tools you expect, presented in a way anyone can understand and use. And anything you create in MakeVR can be exported -- to share with others, to import into other applications, or to be 3D printed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3D Printing For Everyone</h2>MakeVR is a 3D modeling design system for virtual reality that fully supports all major 3D printing platforms.  And everything created in MakeVR can be saved in any standard 3D printing format, and with a click of a button, sent to either a local 3D printer or to a 3D printing service like Shapeways.<br><br><br>With MakeVR, the old challenges of 3D modeling are gone. It frees you from the constraints of complicated, traditional menu-based modeling programs. Imagine being able to physically reach into a 3D scene to grab, interact with, and modify CAD-based solid models just like you manipulate objects in the real world. Now imagine, with the click of a button, sending your creation to a local 3D printer or to a printing service to bring it into the real world.
