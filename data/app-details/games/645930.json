In the list of supported gear we highlight: PlayStation’s AIM / Haptics suits / Guns / Multi-directional locomotion bases. HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR owners will soon get a chance to test this next-level multiplayer VR shooter. It is one of the first titles offering cross-platform multiplayer, allowing deathmatches with console and PC gamers on the same maps.
