The double flames will burn stuff even faster.<br></li><li>Solo Boost - Solo Boost got even more powerful. Boost into other players to make their vehicle go totally berserk or use it to disable enemy abilities, like anchor mode or roadblock.</li></ul><br><strong>Game Content</strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Training - You can now practice and experiment with the game’s mechanics in Training mode, our Tutorial.<br></li><li>Lighting - We’ve upgraded some visual effects, like drifting, smoke, flames and explosions, to make ‘m even more sexy and shiny. <br></li><li>Menu - The menu got a complete overhaul. The homepage now contains news, social buttons and we’ve added new backgrounds everywhere.<br></li><li>Music - We’ve added a new background music track, bringing the total to 3 different tracks. A win or loss tune was also added, depending on your race results. <br></li><li>2v2 race - In this build, the game will also start with 4 players in the lobby, should you not be able to find 6 players in total. It may not be as fun and complete as a 3v3 race, but it’s a whole lot better than waiting!</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Team Racing League</h2>Team Racing League is the first team-based racing game where you win and lose together as a team. Compete in an online 3v3 race where skill and collaboration are key to victory. Team up, strategize and use tactics to disrupt and beat the opposing team in a MOBA-like clash! <br><br>In Team Racing League, there are lots of skill-based mechanics. You can race, crash, boost, drift, block, jump and brake your way to success. Choose to fight for position, play a support role or turn around to troll your opponents. Not everyone on the team needs to race, the others can support the racer by blocking opponents or by connecting your hovercraft with someone from your team. Once connected, you can create speed boosts or extend into a roadblock, making life harder for the opposing team.<br><br>Team Racing League was inspired by retro arcade racing games like Super Off Road, Micro Machines and Championship Sprint. Instead of relying on power-ups, Team Racing League is all about teamwork and racing skills. It aims to be a pure racer, without artificial equalizing mechanics. During the game the complete track and all racers are visible in a top-down view. The mid-poly atmosphere is enhanced by an 80's style synthesizer soundtrack and palpable sound effects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Team-based 3v3 racing<br></li><li>Win together, lose together<br></li><li>Support your teammates and block your opponents<br></li><li>Unique connecting mechanics<br></li><li>Skill-based racing<br></li><li>No power-ups or weapons<br></li><li>Practice against your own ghost</li></ul><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/504460/extras/Steam616x353.png?t=1498742238\">","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Team Racing League</h2>Team Racing League is the first team-based racing game where you win and lose together as a team.
